Humnode is an SPL protocol designed around a reimagined creator-fee architecture, aiming to solve the core problem in meme and community-driven tokens: value often flows to the team while the community remains passive. Humnode’s mission is to turn creator fees into a source of energy for the community, rather than a revenue stream for the team.

In Humnode, every Creator Fee is automatically split and routed by the protocol to holders, LPs, nodes, and ecosystem incentive pools—never to the team wallet. This transforms the token economy from “team-dependent” to “community-sustained,” where trading activity becomes the direct fuel that feeds and supports the entire network.
The more the token moves, the more the community gains; the more active the ecosystem becomes, the stronger and more resilient the internal loop grows.
This creates a new structure:
a self-sustaining network powered by trading, shared by the community, and enforced by protocol logic.

Humnode is not just a new token format—it is a new model of value flow. It turns creator fees from a “cut taken by the team” into a “cycle engine for the ecosystem,” giving tokens the ability to run, feed, and grow on their own.
